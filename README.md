# gray

Welcome to your new Gray Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your scss files in `_sass` and any other assets in `assets` in your respectives folders.

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

This is a simple blog template for Jekyll in wich I created for testing my skyll on Jekyll and Web Developer.

I hope you enjoy it!


## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "gray"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`  and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `gray.gemspec` accordingly.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
